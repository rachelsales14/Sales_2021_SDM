# Sales_2021_SDM
This repository contains the code and data for "Potential distributions of pre-Columbian people in Tropical Andean landscapes."

This repository contains the code and data used to generate the final ensemble species distribution model (SDM) in "Potential distributions of pre-Columbian people in Tropical Andean landscapes." 

The code was developed in R Studio, under R version 4.0.3. The R code file is "EnsembleSDMCode4_12.R" in this repository. 

The "Data" folder contains the archaeological sites used as presence points for the ensemble SDM. 
The "Data" folder also contains the enviornmental variables used to generage the ensemble SDM. Environmental variables are in .tif format. See "Potential distributions of pre-Columbian people in Tropical Andean landscapes" for more details. 

A shapefile was used to crop and mask the environmental variables. This mask is a shapefile created in ArcMap 10.8. The mask is labeled "StudySite" in this repository.
