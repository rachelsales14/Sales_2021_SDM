This repository contains the code and data for the manuscript "Potential distributions of pre-Columbian people in Tropical Andean landscapes." by Sales, Rachel, Crystal McMichael, Suzette G.A. Flantua, Kimberley Hagemans, Jesse R. Zondervan, Catalina Gonz√°lez-Arango, Warren Church, Mark Bush  

This repository contains the code and data used to generate the final ensemble species distribution model (SDM). 

The code was developed in R Studio, under R version 4.0.3. The R code file is "EnsembleSDMCode4_12.R" in this repository. 

## Data
The "Data" folder contains the archaeological sites used as presence points for the ensemble SDM. 
The "Data" folder also contains the enviornmental variables used to generage the ensemble SDM. Environmental variables are in .tif format. See "Potential distributions of pre-Columbian people in Tropical Andean landscapes" for more details. 

A shapefile was used to crop and mask the environmental variables. This mask is a shapefile created in ArcMap 10.8. The mask is labeled "StudySite" in this repository.
